# Niranjan Hasabnis

I am currently a Research Scientist at Machine Programming Lab in Intel Labs. My research interests are at the intersection of application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and formal method techniques to problems in software systems and software engineering, such as bug finding, performance estimation. Recently, I published an automated system, named ControlFlag, that learns to detect programming errors in code. ControlFlag is [open-source now](https://github.com/IntelLabs/control-flag), and has been covered by several news outlets such as [Venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/03/intels-controlflag-taps-ai-to-automatically-detect-errors-in-code/) and [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/intel-unveils-machine-programming-tool-to-detect-bugs-in-code/).

Prior to joining Intel, I was a PhD student at [Secure Systems Lab](http://seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/seclab/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), where I conducted research in program analysis, symbolic execution, machine learning techniques to learn code translators, and binary analysis.
